# Sandwich Stacker
625 Sandwich Stacker was originally created as a Disney.com game, based on the Lilo and Stitch cartoon.
When Adobe Flash was discontinued, and removed from all browsers on December 31st, 2020, many Flash games like Sandwich Stacker were made inaccessible.
As  a way of remembering all of the fun we had playing Sandwich Stacker as kids, my friend Meghan and I decided to remake it from the ground up. They created the artwork for the project, and I created the code for it. 
When the game is finished, we'll be publishing it onto itch.io and Newgrounds.

An archived version of the original game can still be played on Internet Archive's emulator. https://archive.org/details/flash_625-sandwich-stacker
